- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Sealcakes or Taylor Seal for those that know me professionally.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in continuing my education (an active brain is a healthy brain), gaming (but you do need to be able to turn that brain off eventually), cooking, gaming (call of duty and overwatch nerd), reading (currently working on some R.A. Salvatore novels). 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more things at once than I should, actively working on learning some Web Dev fundamentals, HTML, CSS and JavaScript at the moment.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me -- You can reach me on discord at Sealcakes#3816 or via email at Taylorcseal@gmail.com
