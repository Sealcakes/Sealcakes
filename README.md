- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sealcakes or Taylor Seal for those that know me professionally.
- 👀 I’m interested in continuing my education (an active brain is a healthy brain), gaming (but you do need to be able to turn that brain off eventually), cooking, dog training (I know, pretty random), reading (currently working on some R.A. Salvatore novels). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more things at once than I should, actively working on learning Azure, C# and .NET, Terraform, .JSON and eventually I'd like to get some python experience.
- 📫 How to reach me -- You can reach me on discord at Sealcakes#3816 or via email at Taylorcseal@gmail.com
